# SQL Project: Data Engineering and Analysis
This project involved data engineering and analysis tasks using SQL. In PostgreSQL I designed tables to hold data from CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then performed data analysis by answering questions about the data. The project was divided into two main parts: data engineering and data analysis.


## Data Engineering
In this part, I:
* Used the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files.
* Specified data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints for each table.
* Created tables in the correct order to handle foreign keys.
* Imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

## Data Analysis
In this part, I:

* Executed SQL queries to answer specific project questions about the data, such as listing employee details and department information.
* Utilized SQL functions for filtering, joining, and aggregating data to derive meaningful insights.
* Optimized query performance for efficient data retrieval.
